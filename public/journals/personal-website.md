# My Personal Website

This project is my **personal portfolio website** designed to showcase my projects, skills, and experience.  
It was built using **React** and **TailwindCSS** to create a responsive and visually appealing interface.

# How It Started
I wanted a **centralized platform** to display all my coding projects, and I also wanted to practice **frontend web development**.  
The website includes multiple pages: About Me, Projects, and Contact.

# Features
- **Responsive design** — works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.  
- **Project showcase** — each project has a detail page with description, images, and links.  
- **Dynamic components** — uses React components to make the website modular and maintainable.  
- **Clean UI/UX** — TailwindCSS is used for styling and layout.  
- **Easy updates** — new projects can be added without major code changes.

# Challenges
- Organizing multiple React components efficiently.  
- Making the layout responsive across different devices.  
- Ensuring smooth navigation between pages.

# Reflection
This project helped me strengthen my **React skills**, **TailwindCSS design**, and overall web development knowledge.  
It serves as a professional portfolio to present my projects and coding journey.
