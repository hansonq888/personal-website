# How It Started
I built this professional full-stack realtor website using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Firebase**.  
The goal was to create a fully functional site that allows storing and managing property listings while keeping the backend secure.

I began this project in the summer of 2025.  

# My Challenges
- **Firebase Authentication** — set up admin login to securely manage listings.  
- **Database Management** — integrated Firebase Firestore to store listing information dynamically.  
- **Responsive Design** — ensured the website looks good on both desktop and mobile.  
- **Dynamic Listing Pages** — each property has a dedicated page with more details.  

# Features
- Admin backend to add, edit, or delete listings  
- Secure login for the admin using Firebase authentication  
- Dynamic "Listing Details" pages  
- Modern responsive design using Tailwind CSS  

# Reflection
This was my first full-stack project, and I learned a lot about integrating frontend and backend systems.  
Using Firebase made backend management much easier, but I also had to handle security and responsive design challenges.  

I am planning to deploy the website soon and continue improving features like search and filtering for listings.
