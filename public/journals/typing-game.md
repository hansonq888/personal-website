# How it started
I built this typing game as a way to improve my vanilla web development skills.  
I first followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-7eQIHRszQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> to create the basic game structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# My additions
- **WPM calculation** — shows your words per minute at the end of each round.  
- **Last round summary** — displays your previous typing speed for comparison.  
- **Pause & resume** — typing again unpauses the game seamlessly.  
- **Next button** — lets you skip to a new quote instantly.  
- I also watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8-LGhKtzRw&t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> to implement time-based effects that make gameplay more dynamic.

# Reflection
This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event listeners, and game logic. It was also my first experience extending a tutorial into something more personalized and functional.
