# ML Spam Email Detector

This is a **desktop application** built in **Python** to detect whether emails are spam or not.  
The goal was to combine machine learning techniques with practical email filtering.  

I first watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vp87moMmPGI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this tutorial</a> to understand the basics of building a spam detector.

# How It Works
- The app analyzes the content of emails using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques.  
- A **machine learning model** is trained to classify emails as either spam or not spam.  
- The app can be run locally on a desktop to quickly check incoming emails.  

# Features
- **Spam detection** — classifies emails as spam or safe.  
- **Real-time analysis** — can process emails quickly using the trained model.  
- **User-friendly interface** — allows users to input emails and get results.  
- **Integration ready** — can be extended to work with email APIs.  

# Challenges
- Preprocessing email text for machine learning was tricky due to variations in formatting.  
- Balancing the model to reduce **false positives** and **false negatives** required careful tuning.  
- Ensuring the app runs smoothly on a desktop environment.  

# Reflection
This project helped me practice **Python**, **machine learning**, and **NLP**.  
It also gave me hands-on experience building a complete ML application with practical use cases.  

I'm really interested in learning more about **Streamlit** and hope to use **ML** for another project in the near future.
